In this project, my goal was creating a mini-game that everyone can play while chilling. I wanted a game to play easily with just 2 keys but also if you lose your concentrate you will be failed. I did my project using OOP and tkinter of course.I created base class firstly with some common functionality for other classes(paddle,ball,brick).
And then i created other classes that derived from base class. I added needed functions for every class for my game.And finally game class derived from the Frame class in tkinter. It contains the main logic and functions of the game.In summary, the project demonstrates OOP principles by utilizing classes and objects to represent game components. And it relies on the Tkinter library for creating the game's graphical user interface and handling user interactions.
